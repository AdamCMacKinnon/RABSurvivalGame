          <h4>CONCEPT:</h4><br>
          <p>Based on the concepts of NFL Survival Leagues, particpants in the RAB Survival Game select an active MLB team to represent them for one week.
            If the player selected team outscores their combined opponents for that week, the player advances.  If not, they are eliminated.  Last team standing wins!  
          </p>
          <h4>OFFICIAL RULES:</h4><br>
          <h5>ENTRY:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Player must have a valid twitter account that follows the games twitter handle.</li>
            <li>Only one entry per person.  Once your twitter handle is logged into the app, that is the handle you must use to compete (no burners)</li>
            <li>RAB reserves the right to remove any players suspected of having multiple handles, or just generally being "sus" without notice.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <h5>GAMEPLAY:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Players select a team to use for the upcoming week by entering it into the appropriate field on the game page.  That seletion can be changed at will until the weekly deadline.</li>
            <li>The weekly deadline for submissions is Saturday Night at midnight.</li>
            <li>Scores will be tallied from the following Monday, until the end of games on Sunday.</li>
            <li>If the player is eliminated, their account will be disabled from the application.  If you can log in, you are still active.</li>
            <li>Winners will be announced after there is one remaining player, or at the end of the season, should there be multiples.</li>
          </ol>
          <h5>WINNINGS:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>For the 2021 season, it's all for pride.  Winnings will come in future years!</li>

# RABSurvivalGame


1/18/21 STATUS:
DESIGN:
- Design still very basic on game page.
- User's current selection displays beneath submission.  Would like to have previous selections as well.
LOGIC:
- Database should be separate collections by week "week1, week2, etc.." and exported every week to Jim for auditing.
- maybe have another statement populate how many users are currently active?
- When user eliminated, their account is just disabled (prevents login).  Disabling done after Jim audit.
- check with twitter API to see if auto DM can be sent out to user upon disabling account.
